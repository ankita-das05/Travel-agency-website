    Things to do in Ladakh
</h2>
<p>The Ladakh Tourist Packages from SOTC tell you everything you need to know about the activities you can enjoy here!<br><br>
    <b>Hemis National Park Tour:</b> Spend quality time with your significant other on a Ladakh honeymoon tour that includes a visit to the Hemis National Park, known for its snow leopard sightings. A unique national park in North India, it is home to a variety of unusual plants and animals.<br><br>
   <b> Rafting on Whitewater:</b> If you're looking for an inexpensive honeymoon package during the summer, don't ignore the opportunity to go river rafting on the Zanskar River. The rapids and turbulent water while rafting will give you an adrenaline rush.<br><br>
    <b>Trekking:</b> Your honeymoon in Ladakh isn't complete without a hike along one of the hilly terrain's many routes. The Chadar Trek, which takes you along the frozen Zanskar River, is by far the best option for an adventure-filled honeymoon. Treks will enrich your honeymoon experience and tell you more about the local culture!<br><br>
   <b> Safari with Camels:</b> The Nubra Valley camel safari is included in the best honeymoon packages in Ladakh. The Huder Dune Safari is intriguing—too delightful to miss. On your honeymoon in Ladakh, a safari will give you unforgettable moments to take back.<br><br>
    <b>Sunrise at the Shanti Stupa: </b>The Sanchi Stupa was established by Bhikshu Gyomyo Nakamura in 1991, a well-known Japanese Buddhist. The Stupa in Leh is one of the most prominent Tibetan buildings, famous for its architectural beauty. Its white-dome construction is incredibly hypnotic, and the location has a lot to offer. In the serene environment of this Stupa, seeing the sunrise will rejuvenate your soul.     <br><br>
   <b> Look for a Snow Leopard:</b> In Ladakh, there are about 200 snow leopards, and you might spot them at the Hemis Sanctuary. Summer is the best time to see these felines because there is no snow to hide their gleaming white coats.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Places to Visit in Ladakh</h2>
<p>
    Whether it is the gorgeous Buddhist monasteries or the stunning Zanskar Lake, Ladakh is recognised for its natural beauty, and it will take your breath away! This rocky landscape is a magnificent display of natural splendour. Let us look at a few places in Ladakh you might like to visit.<br><br>
<b>The Hall of Fame: </b>This site speaks of the bravery exhibited by soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Kargil war. It tells you incredible stories, making you appreciate all that our military does for us.<br><br>
<b>Leh Palace:</b> This palace in Leh, built in the 17th century by King Sengge Namgyal, is one of the most exquisite architectural wonders you must see during your Ladakh holiday.<br><br>
<b>Magnetic Hill:</b> The scientific community and conspiracy theorists have all been perplexed by this unusual locale, which features a road where vehicles and things seem to roll uphill on their own.<br><br>
<b>Monastery of Phyang:</b> The Phyang Monastery, one of the most well-known Buddhist monasteries in Ladakh, attracts a wide range of religious and spiritual travellers from around the world.<br><br>
<b>Monastery of Thiksey:</b> The Thiksey Monastery, affiliated with the Gelung School of Tibetan Buddhism, is one of Leh's most important religious centres.<br>
    <br>
</p>   
<h2>How to Reach Ladakh</h2>
<p>
    <b>By air:</b> Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport in Leh is the closest airport to Ladakh. With several daily flights to and from Delhi's IGI airport, this airport is connected to practically every major city in India and the world. Because this facility is also a military airport, it is a high-security zone, and you must have hard copies of all your travel documents when flying to Ladakh.<br><br>
    <b>By road:</b> Many government and private bus companies provide buses between Srinagar and Manali and Ladakh and Leh. The journey is exciting since it takes you through valleys and narrow mountain passes. If you start at Srinagar, you'll pass via the Zoji La Pass on your way to Ladakh, while starting in Manali will take you through the spectacular Rohtang Pass.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Food in Ladakh</h2>
<p>
    <b>Chutagi:</b>  It is a vegetable-based soup with bow-tie-shaped flour dumplings. Chutagi, served piping hot, will keep you warm and nourished during your tour to Ladakh.<br><br>
<b>Skew:</b> While Chutagi is a vegetarian soup dumpling, Skew consists of dumplings stuffed with yak meat or mutton. During your Ladakh tour, you'll see skew on a lot of menus.<br><br>
<b>paba:</b> It is a mountain bread made with roasted barley flour, with a little oil and sugar added while kneading. Paba is frequently served with vegetables and buttermilk. This is a traditional Ladakhi dish that you will frequently come across throughout your stay in Ladakh.<br><br>
<b>Thukpa:</b> It is a spicy noodle soup made with vegetables, and it may or may not include meat. What dal and chawal is to the rest of India, Thukpa is to Ladakh. On your Ladakh tour, you'll come across vendors serving steaming hot thukpa everywhere in Leh and Ladakh.<br>
